# Rwanda-s-Air-Quality-Assesment
This project looks at how Car-Free Sundays in Kigali affect air quality, focusing on PM2.5 (fine particulate matter). The data comes from the World Air Quality Historical Database
. To put things in perspective, I compared Kigali’s trends with Kampala, a nearby city that doesn’t have car-free days.

Using Python, I cleaned and analyzed the data, then visualized daily and weekly pollution patterns. The results suggest that car-free Sundays alone don’t lead to big improvements. But Mondays after car-free Sundays showed slightly better air quality compared to other Mondays. Overall, Kampala had higher and more unstable PM2.5 levels than Kigali.

The project runs entirely in a Jupyter Notebook. You just need the dataset (included here), and the code will walk you through the analysis.
